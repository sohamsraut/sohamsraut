# Hi! I'm Soham Raut!
I'm a student developer currently in my 5th year of BS/MS at the **University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering**, working on fun projects that (hopefully) end up making the world a better place. I am (currently) a Researcher at the UW IDL, and I'm also interested in Systems Programming, AI/ML, as well as the math and theory behind CS.
