# Hi! I'm Soham Raut!
I'm a student developer currently in my third year at the **University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering**, aspiring to make the world a better place with tech.
I love CS, and am (currently) interested in AI/ML, Web Development, as well as the math and theory behind CS.
