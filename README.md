# Hi! I'm Soham Raut!
I'm a student developer currently in my second year at the **University of Washington**, aspiring to make the world a better place with tech.
I love CS, and am (currently) mainly interested in AI/ML, Web Development, as well as the Mathematical aspect of CS.

### Things I'm currently learning:
- React.js (Webdev)
- Bootstrap (Webdev)
- Pandas (Python)
- Scikit-learn (Python)
- C++ and C#

**Feel free to check out my projects and give me suggestions for improvement!**
